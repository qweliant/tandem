# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# This part of the document outlines the app, it's functionality, and what it is missing

## App Overview
The quiz app is one page with very user friendly UI. When a user arrives, they can play the game as many times as they would like. The user can totally click through each example and get the right answer, then go through and score themselves. Otherwise, users should have fun with the trivia. The data for the quiz can be substitued with anything that has the same key/value structure, meaning question, incorrect, correct. The user will only be able to submit 10 answers, and can refresh at the end of the game to start another

## Known Bugs
There is an issue with the counter that requires some fine tuning. Since starting at 0, the app must end at 9, but this means the percentage will show 100 percent before the last question is submitted. This also effects submitting the last question for the quiz a bit unintuitive.

## Future Work
Perfect counter variable with useState and useDipatch. Move more functions outside of the compopnent. Add testing. Mock the data apprpriately for testing.
